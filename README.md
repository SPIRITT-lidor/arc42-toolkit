> Provider-agnostic arc42 documentation skills for AI coding assistants — Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codex, and any LLM tool that reads markdown.

Create professional software architecture documentation through guided, interactive AI conversations. Each of the 12 arc42 sections is covered by a dedicated skill that asks the right questions first, generates a structured draft, then iterates until you are satisfied.

---

## Features

- **14 interactive skills** — one per arc42 section, plus quality review and consistency linting
- **Provider-agnostic** — works with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codex, and any LLM tool
- **Ask-first approach** — every skill gathers your project details before generating anything
- **Three depth levels** — LEAN, ESSENTIAL, or THOROUGH, chosen per section based on your needs
- **C4 PlantUML diagrams** — recommended toolkit default for architecture diagrams, stored as separate `.puml` files, never inlined
- **Q42 quality model** — integrates the official Q42 quality model without hardcoded attribute counts
- **Cross-section consistency** — skills check related sections and flag contradictions
- **Automated consistency linting** — catch toolkit convention mismatches such as IF-xx, QS-xx, ADR, and RISK-xx references before they accumulate
- **Official-source grounded** — distinguishes official arc42 guidance from opinionated toolkit conventions

---

## What is arc42?

arc42 is the proven, open-source template for software architecture documentation created by Dr. Gernot Starke and Dr. Peter Hruschka. Used in thousands of projects worldwide, it provides a pragmatic, tool-agnostic approach.

**Core philosophy:**
- Document economically but continuously
- "Painless documentation" — only what stakeholders truly need
- Use the sections that fit your project and stakeholder needs
- Suitable for agile and traditional environments

**Important official guidance:** The Building Block View (Section 5) is mandatory for every architecture documentation in the official arc42 template. Quality goals in Section 1.2 are foundational and should be established early because they influence fundamental architectural decisions.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the toolkit

**APM (Agent Package Manager)**

```bash
apm install MSiccDev/arc42-toolkit --target opencode
```

For other APM-supported agents, replace `opencode` with your target runtime. This installs all 14 skills from the `.apm/skills/` package mirror in one command.

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude plugin install MSiccDev/arc42-toolkit
```

Skills are available as slash commands immediately.

**GitHub Copilot CLI**

```bash
copilot plugin install arc42-toolkit
```

If the arc42-toolkit marketplace is not yet registered, add it first:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add MSiccDev/arc42-toolkit
copilot plugin install arc42-toolkit
```

**OpenAI Codex**

Use the built-in `$skill-installer` inside Codex and provide the repository URL, or install for your user account:

```bash
# User-wide (available in all your projects)
git clone https://github.com/MSiccDev/arc42-toolkit.git ~/.codex/skills/arc42-toolkit

# Project-wide (checked into the repo)
git clone https://github.com/MSiccDev/arc42-toolkit.git .codex/skills/arc42-toolkit
```

**Cursor, Copilot Chat, and other tools**

Clone or copy into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MSiccDev/arc42-toolkit.git
```

Or copy `AGENTS.md`, the `skills/` directory, and the `.agents/` symlink into your existing project.

> **Windows / ZIP installs:** If symlinks are unavailable, create a directory junction instead:
> `mklink /J .agents skills` (Windows CMD) — or simply copy the `skills/` directory to `.agents/`.

### 2. Start with Section 1

Invoke the skill for your AI tool:

| Tool | Command |
|------|----------|
| Claude Code | `/arc42-section-01` |
| GitHub Copilot Chat | `#arc42-section-01` |
| Cursor / Codex | Reference `skills/arc42-section-01/SKILL.md` in context |

### 3. Answer the questions

The skill asks about your project — requirements, stakeholders, quality goals. No generation happens until you have answered.

### 4. Review and iterate

The skill produces a draft, runs a built-in quality checklist, and asks what you want to refine. Repeat until satisfied.

### 5. Continue section by section

Use the same pattern for each section you need. The `/arc42-review` skill validates any section or the full document at any time.

## Three Depth Levels

Every skill supports three depth levels. Choose based on your project's needs — you can use different levels for different sections.

### LEAN (Agile / Minimal)
**Best for:** Agile teams, time-constrained projects, evolving systems

- 1–3 pages per section maximum
- Essential information only — "dare to leave gaps"
- Toolkit recommended minimum: Section 1.2, Section 3, Section 5 Level-1, Section 9, Section 12

### ESSENTIAL (Core Information)
**Best for:** Most projects — the balanced default

- Non-negotiable minimum for production systems
- Critical architectural information enabling team understanding
- Includes LEAN content plus requirements overview, stakeholders, black-box descriptions

### THOROUGH (Comprehensive)
**Best for:** Critical systems, regulated environments, audit requirements, large teams

- Complete documentation across all sections
- Detailed scenarios, multiple diagram levels, extensive validation
- Broad quality scenario coverage guided by the Q42 quality model

---

## How to Use with AI Tools

### Claude Code

```
/arc42-section-01
```

Skills are automatically available as slash commands when `AGENTS.md` and the `skills/` directory (with `.agents/` symlink) are in your project.

### GitHub Copilot

```
#arc42-section-01
```

Use in Copilot Chat. Copilot reads `AGENTS.md` for project context automatically.

### Cursor

Open `skills/arc42-section-01/SKILL.md` in the Composer context, or reference it with `@SKILL.md` in chat.

### Codex / ChatGPT / Other LLMs

Paste the content of the relevant `SKILL.md` file as a system prompt or context message. All skills are plain markdown — they work with any LLM that understands structured text.

---

## Key Benefits

### For Architects
- Save documentation time through guided, structured generation
- Consistent, high-quality output across all sections
- Official-source-grounded documentation without needing to memorise every arc42 detail
- Focus on architectural decisions, not formatting

### For Teams
- Shared vocabulary and structure across the organisation
- Easy onboarding — new members understand the system faster
- Reduced documentation debt through iterative, incremental documentation
- Better stakeholder communication with consistent artifact format

### For Organizations
- Standardized architecture documentation across projects
- Knowledge preservation — decisions and rationale are captured, not just the outcome
- Improved audit readiness
- Scalable process that works from startup to enterprise

---

## Q42 Quality Model Integration

The skills integrate the official **Q42 quality model** as a vocabulary for quality goals and scenarios. To avoid stale documentation, this toolkit does not hardcode quality characteristic counts. Check the current model directly at [quality.arc42.org](https://quality.arc42.org).

The toolkit uses these high-level Q42 tags as pragmatic labels in generated documentation:

`#reliable` `#flexible` `#efficient` `#usable` `#safe` `#secure` `#suitable` `#operable`

Quality goals from Section 1 are traced through constraints, solution strategy, deployment, crosscutting concepts, and quality scenarios.

---

## Consistency Linting

The arc42 toolkit ships a standalone linter that validates cross-section ID consistency in generated documentation that follows this toolkit's conventions. It catches mismatches that accumulate silently over time, such as interface IDs renamed in one section but not another, ADR risks never registered, or quality scenarios with no matching goal.

### What it checks

| Rule | Sections | Validates |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Section 3 ↔ Section 5 | Toolkit `IF-xx` interface IDs match between context and Level-1 building blocks |
| 2 | Section 5 ↔ Section 7 | Every building block name appears in the deployment mapping |
| 3 | Section 1 ↔ Section 10 | Every Q42 tag used in quality scenarios is present in Section 1.2 quality goals |
| 4 | Section 9 ↔ Section 11 | Every toolkit `RISK-xx` in an ADR's "Risks created" field has a Section 11 risk matrix entry |
| 5 | Section 10 ↔ Section 11 | Every aspirational (not yet met) scenario from Section 10.3 is referenced in Section 11 |

### Run locally

```bash
# Check docs/ in English (default)
python scripts/arc42-lint.py

# Check docs written in another language
python scripts/arc42-lint.py --lang de
python scripts/arc42-lint.py --lang fr
python scripts/arc42-lint.py --lang it
python scripts/arc42-lint.py --lang es
python scripts/arc42-lint.py --lang pt

# Check a custom path
python scripts/arc42-lint.py path/to/your/docs --lang de

# Treat warnings as errors (useful in CI)
python scripts/arc42-lint.py --strict
```

Exit code `0` = clean, `1` = issues found.

### GitHub Actions

Copy `templates/arc42-lint.yml` from this repo to `.github/workflows/arc42-lint.yml` in your project. It runs automatically when files under `docs/**` change.

**To use in your own project:** copy the entire `scripts/` directory (script + languages) and `templates/arc42-lint.yml` (to `.github/workflows/arc42-lint.yml`) into your repo. No Python dependencies to install — stdlib only.

### Adding a language

Copy any file from `scripts/languages/` as a starting point, name it `scripts/languages/{code}.json`, and translate the keyword patterns. All values are case-insensitive regular expressions — plain text works too. Multiple alternatives are supported per pattern. Once merged, the new language is available via `--lang {code}`.

### AI-assisted linting

Use `/arc42-lint` to run the linter interactively through your AI tool. The skill runs the script when available, or applies the five rules manually when not. It also offers to fix any issues it finds.

## How This Project Was Created

This repository is a demonstration of AI-assisted technical content development. The arc42 skills were created through iterative collaboration between a human architect (Marco) and Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant), grounded in official arc42 sources throughout.

### Process

1. **Research** — Extensive review of arc42.org, docs.arc42.org, quality.arc42.org, faq.arc42.org
2. **Skill development** — Section-by-section creation of interactive skills following the agentskills.io specification
3. **Quality assurance** — Systematic review against arc42 standards for accuracy and completeness
4. **Iterative refinement** — Multiple review and improvement cycles, including Copilot code review
5. **Provider-agnostic refactor** — Migrated from Copilot-specific prompts to the AGENTS.md + skills standard

### Principles

- **Authenticity first** — all official arc42 guidance is grounded in official sources
- **Clear provenance** — official arc42 guidance is separated from toolkit-specific conventions
- **Human oversight** — human architect provided direction, requirements, and validation
- **AI efficiency** — AI assistant handled research, synthesis, and structured content creation

### Transparency

This repository was researched and structured by AI from authoritative arc42 sources, directed by human expertise in software architecture, validated through systematic quality reviews, and is maintained with ongoing human oversight.
